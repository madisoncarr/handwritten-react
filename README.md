# Handwritten
Handwritten is a 3-day hackathon project which uses machine learning to create a neural network which reads handwritten numbers with a 92% accuracy. The neural network was created using the MNIST dataset and the brain.js library. Handwritten is deployed at [read-handwritten.herokuapp.com](https://read-handwritten.herokuapp.com).
